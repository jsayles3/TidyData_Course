## Variables
- `subject`: Identifier for the individual who performed the activity.
- `activity`: Descriptive name of the activity performed.
- Measurements: Includes the mean and standard deviation for each recorded measurement.

## Data Transformations
1. Combined the training and test data sets into one comprehensive data set.
2. Extracted only the measurements that include the mean and standard deviation.
3. Replaced activity IDs with descriptive activity names for clarity.
4. Labeled the data set with clear and descriptive variable names.
5. Generated a second tidy data set that calculates the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
